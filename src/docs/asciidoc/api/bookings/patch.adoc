=== Patch a Booking

Patches the specified booking by setting the values of the parameters passed.
Any parameters not provided will be left unchanged.
For example, if you pass the start parameter, that becomes the bookingsâ€™ start date.

This request accepts mostly the same arguments as the booking creation call.

==== Parameters

include::{snippets}/api/bookings/patch/404/path-parameters.adoc[]

==== Returns

Returns the Booking object after successful booking patch.
Raises an error if create parameters are invalid (for example, request payload missing any field).

if there is no Booking with path parameter id, returns not found status with a proper error message in the response.
