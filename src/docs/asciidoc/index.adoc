== Overview

This repository contains a WebService that supports a REST API to handle bookings.

=== Terminology

A booking is when a guest selects a start and end date and submits a reservation on a property.
A block is when the property owner or manager selects a range of days during which no guest can make a booking (e.g. the owner wants to use the property for themselves, or the property manager needs to schedule the repainting of a few rooms).

`SampleRestAssuredApplicationTests` makes a call to a very simple service.
The service that is being tested is running on a random port on `localhost`.
The tests make use of a preprocessor to modify the request so that it appears to have been sent to
`https://api.example.com`.
If your service includes URIs in its responses, for example because it uses hypermedia, similar preprocessing can be applied to the response before it is documented.

Three snippets are produced.
One showing how to make a request using cURL:
